        <h1>About Primitive Technology</h1>

        <p>Primitive technology is a hobby where you make things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. This is the strict rule. If you want a fire- use fire sticks, an axe- pick up a stone and shape it, a hut- build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without modern technology. If this hobby interests you then this blog might be what you are looking for.-</p>
        
        <p>Also It should be noted that I don’t live in the wild but just practice this as a hobby. I live in a modern house and eat modern food. I just like to see how people in ancient times built and made things. It is a good hobby that keeps you fit and doesn’t cost anything apart from time and effort.</p>

I do not have a Facebook page and if you see any they are fake.-</p>
        
        <p>FAQ:</p>

        <p>Q. Where is this?</p>

        <p>A. Far North Queensland, Australia.</p>

        <p>Q.What stops the rain from washing the mud off the hut walls?</p>

        <p>A. The roof. You’ll notice the eves of the roof extend out from the walls- this keeps the walls dry.</p>

        <p>Q. What dangerous animals are there?</p>

        <p>A. Only venomous snakes and I need to watch where I step. Crocodiles don’t live where I build these huts and there are no large land predators in the bush here (that I’m aware of).</p>

        <p>Q. How do I know what good clay is?</p>

        <p>A. Look in creek banks and under top soil. Wet some and roll it into a coil as thick as a pencil then wrap it round a finger. If it doesn’t completely break apart then it’s suitable.</p>

        <p>Q. How do you keep mosquitoes away?</p>

        <p>A. Smokey fire tends to keep them away especially inside a dwelling.</p>
