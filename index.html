            <h2>A Star Is Born review – a double act to leave you star-struck</h2>

            <hr>

            <p class="paragraph">Each generation has its own version of A Star Is Born, a timeless tale (prefigured by George Cukor’s What Price Hollywood?) of intersecting career trajectories. In the 1930s, William Wellman directed Janet Gaynor as the young actress on the way up who falls for alcoholic fading idol Fredric March. Judy Garland and James Mason reprised the roles in Cukor’s 1954 classic, setting a musical template mirrored in subsequent versions. Barbra Streisand famously wanted Elvis to star opposite her in Frank Pierson’s 70s remake, and it still breaks my heart that Presley never got to play what would surely have been his defining screen role (Kris Kristofferson landed the part of a rock star in decline.)</p>

            <h2>God Is An Astronaut</h2>

            <hr>

            <p class="paragraph">God Is an Astronaut are an acclaimed group from Ireland whose primarily instrumental music combines the epic melodies of post-rock, the precision of electronic-fueled Krautrock à la Tangerine Dream, and elements of space rock. The band is known for an active antiwar stance and fierce live performances, which place considerable emphasis on the visuals. Their shows, especially in the band's earlier days, have included self-compiled videos for each song and a lot of lighting work. Over time, their albums have incorporated horn arrangements and unobtrusive vocals, but their music has remained heavily atmospheric yet melodic and urgent.</p>

            <h2>About Primitive Technology</h2>

            <hr>

            <p class="paragraph">Primitive technology is a hobby where you make things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. This is the strict rule. If you want a fire- use fire sticks, an axe- pick up a stone and shape it, a hut- build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without modern technology. If this hobby interests you then this blog might be what you are looking for.</p>
